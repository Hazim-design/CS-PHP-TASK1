    <h1>First Story - Life as a Pencil</h1>
<?php
echo 'Once upon a time, in a bustling pencil factory, a tiny pencil was born. ';
echo 'Crafted from the finest cedar wood, the pencil was proud of its sleek design and sharp graphite tip. ';
echo 'But it was unaware of the journey that lay ahead. ';
echo 'The pencil was soon sold and handed to a young artist. ';
echo 'With each sketch and stroke, it brought ideas to life, transforming blank pages into vibrant portraits of imagination. ';
echo '<br><br>';
echo 'As time passed, the pencil grew shorter. ';
echo 'It feared it was losing its value, but the artist reminded it: ';
echo '“Your worth isn’t in your size but in the marks you leave behind.” ';
echo 'The pencil learned that even when it felt worn down, its purpose was far greater than it could have imagined.';
