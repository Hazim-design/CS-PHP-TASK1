<?php
echo 'Life in a classroom was tough for the pencil. ';
echo 'Each day, it faced the trials of being chewed on by nervous students, dropped to the floor, or forgotten in backpacks. ';
echo 'Yet, it endured. ';
echo 'The pencilâ€™s finest moment came when a young boy, struggling to learn cursive, finally succeeded. ';
echo 'Each carefully crafted loop and curve was a testament to perseverance. ';
echo '<br><br>';
echo 'The pencil realized that its trials were worth it. ';
echo 'Every mistake it erased, every word it helped write, made it a silent companion in the pursuit of knowledge. ';
echo 'Even in hardship, it found joy in serving its purpose.';
